# SQLite connection methods:
# Python: sqlite3.connect('myapp.db')
# Connection string: sqlite:////home/kavia/workspace/code-generation/simple-to-do-list-297134-297144/database/myapp.db
# File path: /home/kavia/workspace/code-generation/simple-to-do-list-297134-297144/database/myapp.db
# Usage notes:
# - Always enable foreign keys after connecting: cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON")
